# Analysis of Global Education Statistics

This defines an analysis of global education statistics as provided by the world-bank. This code is related to my [medium article](https://medium.com/@felixnext92) about the topic.

## Getting Started

The entire code can be found in the jupyter notebooks. Just run `jupyter lab .`

(Assuming that you have [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed).

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following datasets:

* WorldBank Education Statistics (version used here is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/education-statistics/version/45#) - There might be a newer version available on the [WorldBank Homepage](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/education/home))
* Economic Indicators from the WorldBank Data (can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) - the datasets folder contains a script to crawl the relevant data)
